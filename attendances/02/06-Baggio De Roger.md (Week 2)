Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offers a wide range of products that helps build, migrate, operate, and enhance applications and workloads. 
Here is the list of the services provided by OCI by category:
  -	SaaS which includes webmail and ERP
  -	PaaS which includes Java and OS, etc.
  -	IaaS which are the OCI core services.
The OCI Core Services list: 
  -	Compute: consisting of 5 components (bare metal, dedicated virtual hosts, virtual machines, container engines and functions).
  -	Storage: requires specifications (persistent/non-persistent support, multiple formats, cost effective, data protection against hardware damage, local storage and data accessibility).
  -	Networking (VCN): which allows users to manage existing networks in a cloud environment. In this case, we can set the IP Address, create subnets and route tables, 
  also configure the firewall. Here are some components in the VCN (subnets, Route table, Security List).
  -	IAM (Identity and Access Management): which allows you to control who has access to the cloud resources you own, and what type of access they have, and to specific resources.
  Its collection of interrelated resources compartment will help users to determine the access to their own resources.  
  -	Database Cloud Service: Oracle provides an extremely fast and effective database cloud service and here’s why.
    •	Oracle is the only public cloud that supports VM database systems, offering extremely fast provisioning.
    •	It also supports bare metal database systems, which are known to be super-fast.
    •	Real Application Clusters is an option for users for managing high availability and performance
    •	The Exadata DB system, which offers extreme performance for both Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and data warehouse applications.
    •	The Autonomous database is built on Oracle's highly available Exadata architecture, so you can easily scale your database deployment.
There are three models of Autonomous databases that are provided by OCI as of right now, ATP, ADW and Autonomous JSON.
ATP is a cloud database service that removes the complexity of operating and securing high performance databases. 
ADW is a Data Warehouse service that removes all the hassle of operating a Data Warehouse, securing data and developing data-driven applications. 
The Oracle Autonomous JSON database is a document database that facilitates the development of JSON-centric applications.
