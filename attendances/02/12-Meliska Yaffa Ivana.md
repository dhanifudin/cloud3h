    <h2>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)</h2>
<body>
    <p>Have three category of cloud : Iaas, PaaS, SaaS.There are 5 services of OCI Services :</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Compute</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bare metal => use to handle virtualization, operating system, language runtime, app containers and code</li>
                <li>Dedicated virtual hosts =>use to handle operating system, language runtime, app containers and code but host is single tenant model, so no resources will be shared with other users and virtualization handles by oracle</li>
                <li>Virtual machines => use to handle operating system, language runtime, app containers and code but multitenant model with hypervisor-based virtualization and can sharing resources with other users</li>
                <li>Container engines => use to handle app containers and code. The service is container runtime environment that execute and manages container images on nodes</li>
                <li>Function => to handle code. So the user can write a simple code without worring about the infrastructure</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Storage</li>
        Computing on applications requires storage with certain specifications. There are 5 storage supported by OCI, namely block volume, local NVME, file storage, object storage and archive storage.
        <li>Networking</li>
        VCN (Virtual Cloud Network) is a network owned by VM and is an infrastructure as a IaaS service. VCN allows users to manage existing networks in a cloud environment.  Some component of VCn : Subnets, Nat Gateway, Service Gateway, Route Table, etc
        <li>Identity and Access Management(IAM</li>
        To control who has access to the cloud resources you own, and what type of access they have, and to specific resources.
        <li>Database Cloud Service</li>
        The Autonomous database is built on Oracle's highly available Exadata architecture, so you can easily scale your database deployment. Some models of autonomous databases are Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing, (ATP) and Autonomous JSON.
    </ol>
