Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Core Services
OCI Core Services includes 5 things, such as:

1. Compute OCI Compute Service consists of 5 components, namely bare metal, dedicated virtual hosts, virtual machines, container engines and functions. The further to the right the less the user needs to handle. Conversely, the more to the left, the more will be handled or managed by the user.

2. Storage
   A. Storage Model
   Computing on applications requires storage with certain specifications. The following is the OCI storage model, such as:
   a. Supports persistent and non-persistent storage
   b. Multiple formats such as structured, semi-structured and streaming data
   c. High Performance Computing at a low cost
   d. Data is protected against hardware damage
   e. Data can be stored locally for personal use or remote storage for data sharing purposes
   f. Data is accessed using a specific protocol
   B. Storage Services
   There are 5 storage services supported by OCI :
   a.block volume
   b.local NVME
   c.file storage
   d.object storage
   d.archive storage

3. Networking Oracle VCN stands for Virtual Cloud Network. VCN is an Infrastructures as a Service (IaaS) service. VCN is a network owned by your VM. VCN allows users to manage existing networks in a cloud environment. In this case, we can set the IP Address, create subnets and route tables, also configure the firewall. The benefits of Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) are:
   a. To extend the local network to Oracle Cloud.
   b. Improves security on VM networks.
   c. Manage incoming and outgoing data traffic
   Some of the components contained in the VCN, such as:
   a. Subnets
   b. Route Table
   c. Security List
   d. Internet Gateway
   e. Nat Gateway
   f. Service Gateway
   g. Dynamic Router Gateway

4. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
   Next, I'll cover OCI Identity and Access Management. OCI Identity and Access Management services can be abbreviated as IAM. IAM lets you control who has access to your cloud resources, and what type of access they have, and to specific resources. IAM policies are documents that define who and how can be used to access resources.

5. Database Cloud Service
   Next, we'll cover OCI Database Services. As we discussed, Oracle is the only public cloud that supports VM database systems, which offers extremely fast provisioning. OCI also supports bare metal database systems, which are extremely fast.
   Some models of autonomous databases are Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing, (ATP) and Autonomous JSON.
