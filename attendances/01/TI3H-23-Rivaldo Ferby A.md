1.Cloud computing is the on-demand access to computer resources located in faraway data centers controlled by cloud services through the Internet-applications, servers (physical and virtual), data storage, development tools, network operations, and so on. CSP charges a monthly fee or charges based on usage for various resources.

2.Service of Cloud Computing
-IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)
IaaS gives pay-as-you-go access to basic computing resources such as real and virtual servers, networking, and storage through the internet.
End users may expand and decrease resources as required using IaaS, which eliminates the need for large, upfront capital expenditures, unneeded on-premises or ‘owned' infrastructure, and overbuying capacity to accommodate periodic spikes in demand.
IaaS, in contrast to SaaS and PaaS (and even newer PaaS computing paradigms like containers and serverless), gives customers the most control over cloud computing resources.

-PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)
PaaS offers software developers with an on-demand platform—hardware, a complete software stack, infrastructure, and even development tools—for operating, creating, and managing applications without the expense, complexity, or inflexibility of doing so on-premises.
With PaaS, the cloud provider manages everything in their data center, including servers, networks, storage, operating system software, middleware, and databases.
To run, build, test, deploy, manage, update, and grow applications, developers just select from a menu to ‘spin up' servers and environments.

-SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
SaaS (also known as cloud-based software or cloud application) is cloud-based application software that may be accessed and used through a web browser, a specialized desktop client, or an API linked with a desktop or mobile operating system. SaaS customers typically pay monthly or yearly fees, however some may offer "pay as you go" pricing depending on actual usage.

-Serverless Computing
Serverless computing (sometimes known as just serverless) is a cloud computing architecture that delegates all backend infrastructure maintenance chores to the cloud provider, allowing developers to concentrate all of their time and effort on the code and business logic unique to their applications.
Furthermore, serverless only runs application code per-request and automatically adjusts the supporting infrastructure up and down in response to the amount of requests.
Customers never pay for idle capacity when using serverless since they only pay for the resources utilized while the application is operating.

3.Types of cloud computing

-Public Cloud
A public cloud is a type of cloud computing in which a cloud service provider makes computing resources available to users over the public internet, ranging from SaaS applications to individual virtual machines (VMs), bare metal computing hardware, and complete enterprise-grade infrastructures and development platforms. These materials may be available for free, or they may be available for a fee based on a subscription or pay-per-use basis.

-Private Cloud
A private cloud environment is one in which all cloud infrastructure and computing resources are devoted to and accessible by only one customer. Private cloud combines the flexibility, scalability, and simplicity of service delivery of cloud computing with the access control, security, and resource customization of on-premises infrastructure.
In most cases, a private cloud is hosted on-premises in the customer's data center. A private cloud, on the other hand, can be constructed on rented infrastructure in an offsite data center or hosted on the infrastructure of an independent cloud provider.
Many businesses choose private cloud to public cloud because it is a more convenient (or the only) option to satisfy regulatory compliance requirements.
