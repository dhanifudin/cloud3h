cloud computing is a method of delivering various services over the internet. 
The resources in question are examples of applications such as data storage, servers, databases, networks, and software.

Instead of storing lots of files on your hard drive or local storage on your computer or phone, cloud-based storage lets you store files as long as you have access to the internet.

Cloud computing is a popular option because it has many advantages, such as cost savings, increased productivity, speed, efficiency, performance, and security. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that many companies or people use the cloud to store data.

Types of cloud computing based on the service
1. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) involves licensing a software application to its user. These licenses are usually granted via a pay-as-you-go or on-demand method. This type can be found in Microsoft Office's 365
2. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) involves a method for delivering a file from the operating system to the server and storage, via IP-based connectivity as part of an on-demand service. Clients don't need to buy software or servers. Popular examples of this type are Public Cloud from Indonesian Cloud and Microsoft Azure.
3. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is touted as the most complex. PaaS is almost similar to SaaS, but the biggest difference is that, instead of sending software via online, PaaS is actually a platform for creating software that is delivered over the internet. Examples of PaaS are Salesforce.com and Heroku.
