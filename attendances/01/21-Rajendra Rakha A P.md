# **Cloud computing**

Get to know Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a platform to perform various kinds of services that will always be available and at any time. Cloud computing is also flexible depending on how much nominal we pay. Hardware and software for cloud computing can be made available to the public and enterprises. Because it is always available, so how to access it needs to be connected to the internet.

# **Main Characteristics of Cloud Computing**

Massive Scale, users can come from anyone.
Virtualization, in a computer can be broken down more than one cloud computer.
Cheap software, because technological advances make open-source software easier to implement in cloud computing.
High security, the presence of many users makes cloud computing must have extra security.
Virtualization
The high price for making a cloud computer means that technology develops virtualization so that a cloud computer can run many cloud computers at once. This allows one party who has a large cost to be able to buy a set of high-spec hardware and then in software that is made a cloud computer with specifications that are shared from the main hardware, and this computer can be rented out to anyone who needs and has the ability. From the results of splitting a piece of hardware into several cloud computers that can run simultaneously, of course the resulting specifications will be much smaller, this is what makes the tenants have to be smart in choosing the software that will be the operating system of the cloud computer.

# **Various kinds of virtual cloud computer providers**

Cloud computers are better known as VPS (Virtual Private Server) because of their "virtual" nature.

Here's an example of a VPS provider:

1. Amazon Web Services (AWS)

2. Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

3. Microsoft Azure

4. Fortune-teller

5. Alibaba Cloud

6. IBM

# **Advantages of using Cloud Computing**

1. Reducing the cost of purchasing hardware, with cloud computing, the need for hardware will be reduced

2. Performance can be increased as needed, the flexibility of cloud computing is wrong if specifications can be upgraded more easily

3. Software used as open source and used in multiple platforms

4. Easy and fast upgrade software

5. Virtually unlimited storage capacity
6. Data reliability, namely minimizing data loss, because there are many systems that back up data
7. It's easy to work with more than one individual
8. Access to cloud computing is very easy and can be done through any platform that supports it

# **Disadvantages of using Cloud Computing**

1. the need for an internet connection that is always connected
2. Does not work well when network speed is low
3. available features may be limited
