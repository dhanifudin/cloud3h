# Cloud Environment

## Definition of Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is a general term used to describe a new class of network-based computing that occurs over the Internet,is basically a step up from Utility Computing.
Cloud Computing is used for computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, network capabilities, and more—hosted in remote data centers managed by a cloud service provider (or CSP). In short, Cloud Computing can be define as system which :
 - Shared pool of configurable computing resources
 - On-demand network access
 - Provisioned by the Service Provider

- Low Cost Software
- Resilient Computing
- Geographic Distribution
- Service Orientation
- Advanced Security

### __2. Essential Characteristics__
- On Demand Self-Service
- Broad Network Access

## Cloud Architecture
### 1. Service Value Nets
### 2. Platform as a Service
### 3. Infastructure as a Service

## Advantage of Cloud Computing
### __1. Lower IT Costs__
Cloud computing is fairly inexpensive but can be used to purchase, install, configure and manage your own on-premises infrastructure	
### __2. Improve agility and time-to-value__
With cloud, your organization can start using enterprise applications in minutes, instead of waiting weeks or months for IT to respond to a request, purchase and configure supporting hardware, and install software.
### __3. Scale more easily and cost-effectively__
Cloud provides elasticity—instead of purchasing excess capacity that sits unused during slow periods, anyone who use cloud computing can scale capacity up and down in response to spikes and dips in traffic.
